Here I am, making my debut into the modeling scene, I hope everything is up to par. I have been working on this pack for about a month and it is finally done, Arizona DPS.


This is also my first ever project with ZModeler and I literally learned the program just to make this.


These vehicles are near-accurate to the actual Arizona DPS and are the main vehicles they use, I am also dissapointed that I wasn't able to include a 2013 FPIU, but I can't find any free dev models. I have made these vehicles with an extremely large focus on accuracy to the agency. They feature the following;


- Lighting reminiscent of Arizona DPS's actual fleet ( Valors, Excaliburs, Lighting placements )

- Each vehicle has an unmarked and slicktop counterpart.

- Fully custom carcols made by yours truly to capture Arizona DPS's actual patterns as close as non-els allows.

- Custom liveries made by me with accuracy to their actual liveries.

- Interiors with radar, MDT, console, SmartSiren, gun rack, partition, ticket printer, and radio. ( No trunk stuff, sorry. )

Most of the vehicles include extras to add/remove antennae, siren boxes, and the ability to turn off all the front lighting for traffic stops, just like real DPS!


I truly hope these are up to par with everyone's non-els standards and that they will put some decent Arizona DPS non-els models out into the world. The pack also includes templates, and a free SmartSiren (Arizona DPS's siren) that I have put together.


 I am also not able to give installation instructions because I do not actually know how to install stuff to normal GTA, just FiveM. Sorry. Thanks for reading, and I really, really, hope you enjoy.
