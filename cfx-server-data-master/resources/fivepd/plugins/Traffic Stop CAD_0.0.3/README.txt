I made some changes...

I renamed the files so they make for sense, so pay attention if you installed this plugin previosuly.

put TrafficStopCallout.net.dll in your FivePD>callouts folder
put GenerateTrafficStop.net.dll in your FivePD>plugins folder


TrafficStopCallout.net.dll replaces TrafficStopCAD.net.dll
GenerateTrafficStop.net.dll replaces TrafficStopMenu.net.dll

New Features:
- If you are responding to another callout and make a traffic stop, your callout will be cancelled and you will get a callout for the traffic stop.
- If you are on scene (or in the vicinity of another callout) and make a traffic stop (most likely related to the callout) then you will not get a callout for the traffic stop.
